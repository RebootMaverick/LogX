# LogX
LogX, this is a homebrew module I made It is currently under development and is a module developed to display log levels in a more simplified manner Currently it has only one function, but I plan to add various functions in the future.

Thus, with super-simple letters.

You can display these stylish and simple log levels.

You can also optionally set Path at the end of the argument to leave the Log in some file

Currently, only messages are logged, but when we have time, or the next time we update, we will make sure to write the time and log level as well.
Other features we are planning to add include a super easy logging function, etc. Stay tuned for other features!
And if we are successful, we pledge to publish it on pip!
But LogX is already available on pip!
So I will have to Pip it under a different name.
